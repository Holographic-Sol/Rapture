Copy Source to Destination EXTREMELY fast.



WHAT DOES IT DO?
Mode 1: (Default) Copy Missing - Only copies file names not found in destination directory.
Mode one is useful if you dont edit the files. (like a music library, picture directory etc...)

Mode 2: Comprehensive - Is Mode One plus compares file timestamps so if source timestamp is newer than destination timestamp destination file will be ammended.
Mode two is useful if you edit files. (documents, or you edit your music and pictures too you can still use it...)



WHAT DOES IT NOT DO?
This not designed to delete files and folders from your chosen backup destination.



WHY?
1. Alot of the time I am editing many files in many places and find myself going in and out of directories everywhere copying things over to backup drives.
2. If I do 1^ alot over time, what need's copying? Maybe I will copy everything to be sure? Not anymore.
2. I wrote this because I have a lot of files and when i back up id like it to be faster and so instead of procrastinating i saved my future self time and kept leanrning.



NOTES:
1. Running in admin account is preferable.
2. Initial backup will of course take time but after that it can be insanely fast once only new/new+ammended files are being written to the destination.
3. Try it with a huge Steam library and you will see.
