Backs up target directory extremely fast.

Mode 1: (Default): Copy Missing - Only copies file names not found in backup directory.
Mode 1: button has white and green arrows to show it is in Mode 1.

Mode 2: Comprehensive - Is Mode One plus compares file timestamps and copy if source timestamp is newer than backup timestamp.
Mode 2: button has white arrows to show it is in Mode 2.

Mode 1 is useful if you dont edit the files. (like a music library, picture directory etc...)
Mode 2 is useful if you edit files. (documents, or you edit your music and pictures too you can still use it...)

Configure in config.txt before use!

Initial backup will of course take time but after that it can be insanely fast.

The Yellow Button: ? :) Syncronizes timestamps between source and destination directory. PRESS IT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS!
If you press the yellow button? Mode 2 becomes useful in ways time diddn't know was possible.

Timestamp syncronization is my solution to replace the slower file contents compare in my previous rapture programs.
The Yellow button means you can scan 37GB+ of data in less than 2 seconds while in Mode 2, write changes to destination and done!
Press it once. Respectively (Use it logically to syncronize here and there, not all the time (unless thats your thing...?)).

I wrote this because I have a lot of files and when i back up id like it to be faster and
so instead of procrastinating i saved my future self time.

Please excuse my GUI as I like to focus my creativity on making things functional before anything else :)

This will not delete 'depricated' files and folders from your chosen backup destination.
Please ensure destination directory exists by creating it. (configuration menu undeveloped)
