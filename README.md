NOTE:
Please take the time to understand how each backup mode works before using it to back up.

Recent Experiment In Write Mode 1: Codename 'Rapture Steam Game Planetary Annihilation Titans':
Steam Game before downloading Planetary Annihilation Titans update: 3,638,532,352 bytes.
Steam Game after downloading Planetary Annihilation Titans update:  3,639,084,249 bytes.
Time to backup whole game (3,638,532,352 bytes): approx. 3 minutes.
Time to Rapture the game: approx. 2 seconds.
Result: The Raptured games plays.
Conclusion: I will keep working on project rapture as many Steam libraries are TB's and this makes updating backups of files including large games, extremely fast.

1.24TB Steam Library Backup not updated for 9 months+ took 40 minutes using timestanp compare mode. Games Play :)
