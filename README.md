NOTE:
Please take the time to understand how each backup mode works before using it to back up.

Recent Experiment In Write Mode 1: Codename 'Rapture Steam Game Planetary Annihilation Titans':
Steam Game before downloading steam update: 3,638,532,352 bytes
Steam Game after downloading steam update:  3,639,084,249 bytes
Time to backup whole game (3,638,532,352 bytes): approx. 3 minutes.
Time to Rapture the game: approx. 2 seconds.
Result: The Raptured games plays.
Conclusion: I will keep working on project rapture as many Steam libraries are TB's and this makes updating backups of files including large games, extremely fast.

That is all.
